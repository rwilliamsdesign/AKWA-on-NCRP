    As the lads and I are preparing our gear for the repair jobs of the day, we see a lone survivor on the horizon coming our way, cap in hand. <br><br>
    
    Is this our ex-employee? Returning to right his wrongs and needing to be shown the errors of his ways?<br><br>
    
    You fucking better believe it is. <br><br>
    
    The boys go off and do our repair jobs, offering apprenticeships out to whoever we meet. <br><br>
    
    We spend the night down the boozer and have a few sherberts and a sing song. <br><br>
    
    Then with a belly full of piss water and dutch courage we head up north for a tear up with those dutch mugs. <br><br>
    
    It doesn't end well, seeing double doesn't help in a fire fight. <br><br>
    
    I prefer the seaside anyway. <br><br>

So it's been an eventful week for AKWA. We managed to write off our new Transit van about 50 meters from the Elektro showroom, losing lives and about 5 grands worth of tools in the process. <br><br>

Met a sound welsh lad on the Friday shift who put in his fair share of graft, Greg's a bit worried he'll take over from his tea making <br><br>

Linda completed her apprenticeship with stellar marks, the two new designs for containment units she submitted for her thesis may finally be the key to curbing the spread of this disease. <br><br>

Thieves half-inched another 3 grands worth of tools too, but the silly sods forgot the scratch off the serial numbers so managed to make a deal with the manager of Cash Converters and got 'em back sharpish, no fuss. In other words, 'Give em back now or we'll rip up your patio'<br><br>
No sign of the Mikita radio so will have to re-order, nothing like listening to my favourite Backstreet Boys CD when on shift. <br><br><br> <br>

Just flew back from Thailand, customs clearance was a bit dodgy at North West but  got through OK, it's amazing what you can smuggle in a human body. @DeadSpaniel now goes by the name of Linda after meeting a doctor the other night, says he doesn't remember anything. <br><br>

 @bantamgreg was probably the only person in recorded history to walk around Thailand in a Bradford city shirt, there were looks of terror, confusion and pity from the locals. <br><br>

@(W.T.M)UnxcrnnðŸ¦„ got himself a really cool Thai symbol tattoo that supposedly means 'taxes, honour, death' but we'll give it a week or two before admitting to him it actually says "add 30p to go large". <br><br>

Ryan finally got his milkshake and returned with some fancy braids with beads on the end.... Like you do. <br><br>

Selling 20 B&H for 2 quid, and 50g pouches of GV for a fiver. <br><br>

Thought I'd take the lads off on an expenses paid holiday to Thailand. It's been a messy affair. @DeadSpaniel has pissed his bed three nights in a row, @bantamgreg went missing for a day and half, came back and has been throwing up constantly and saying "I've done things no man should ever go through" over and over, something about ping pong balls, pliers, gas masks and bananas???. @Kid Whack went off to find a Dairy Queen and not been seen since. Me and @(W.T.M)UnxcrnnðŸ¦„ are off to meet up with these Thai girls we met last night, their voices are a bit deep but i guess thats just due to the humidity. <br><br>

It's a good chance to recharge our batteries, let our hair down and come back with a more determined and positive frame of mind. <br><br>

Secretary Linda has been keeping me informed of the events happening back home. We hope they all use common sense and only drink soda cans and chlorine purified water. Strenuous water testing will be carried out once we continue otherwise. <br><br>

Right wheres me fackin' fishbowl. <br><br>

Flight over from Livonia wasn't too bad turbulence wise. Although there were plenty of passengers with children crying 'WAAAA-ARE WE THERE YET' and "HOW MUCH LONGER IS IT GUNNA BE!!!"...all the airline staff were great, especially the airline hostess @bantamgreg, cracking arse on it. Bit broad shoulders but I ain't fussy. <br><br>

Big shock as Chernarus is colder than Livonia and the place is just as much of a shithole. Pubs shut, Bingo halls shut, you name it. The missus is giving me a right earful., she wanted to go Lanzarote. <br><br>

Oh well time to get cracking, those free drinks on the flight are the last these poor fuckers are gonna get... <br><br>
